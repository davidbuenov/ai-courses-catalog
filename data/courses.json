  "description": "This course, built in partnership with Anthropic, teaches the core concepts of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and how to implement it in your AI applications. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how Large Language Model (LLM) applications can get access to context in terms of tools and data resources, based on a client-server architecture. It defines how communication takes place between an MCP client, hosted inside your own LLM application, and an MCP server that exposes tools, data resources, and prompt templates to your application. MCP originated as part of an internal Anthropic project to extend the capabilities of Claude Desktop, allowing it to interact with local file systems and other external systems. The protocol was found useful in many AI applications and was subsequently published as open source to make it available to more developers.\n\nThe MCP ecosystem is growing rapidly and includes a number of MCP services developed by the open-source community and Anthropic's MCP team . It is model agnostic and designed to be easy to plug into multiple applications. For instance, a research assistant agent could connect to GitHub, Google Drive, and File System services via MCP to access and summarize data, without you having to write custom LLM tools.\n\nThe course curriculum includes a deep dive into the MCP client-server architecture, making a chatbot application MCP compatible, building and testing an MCP server, and connecting the chatbot to it. You will also learn to connect your chatbot to other trusted third-party servers to extend its capabilities, re-use your MCP server with other MCP applications like Claude Desktop, and deploy your MCP server remotely. The instructor for this course is Elie Schoppik, Head of Technical Education at Anthropic. This technology significantly eases the process for LLM application developers to connect their systems to various tools and data resources, and for tool/data providers to make their offerings accessible to many developers.",

  "description": "This youtube video provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client and server from scratch using Python. It covers the essential setup, including initializing a Python environment, creating a virtual environment, and installing necessary libraries such as `FasMCP`, `MCP_Types`, `asyncio`, and `Pathlib`. The tutorial demonstrates how to build an MCP server, defining tools (e.g., a 'Hello World' tool) and their descriptions, which are crucial for clients and Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand when to call them. It then walks through the process of creating an MCP client that connects to the server, makes requests to its tools, and processes the text-based responses. The video also includes a section on error handling for robust application development. A key highlight is the demonstration of how to integrate the custom-built MCP server with Claude Desktop by configuring the `claude_desktop_config` file, allowing Claude AI to interact with your local MCP server and its defined tools. This practical 'Hello World' example serves as a fundamental base for developing more complex AI applications that leverage the MCP client-server architecture. The MCP itself is an open protocol that standardizes how LLM applications can access context, tools, and data resources through a client-server model.",
