    "description": "This course, built in partnership with Anthropic, teaches the core concepts of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and how to implement it in your AI applications. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how Large Language Model (LLM) applications can get access to context in terms of tools and data resources, based on a client-server architecture. It defines how communication takes place between an MCP client, hosted inside your own LLM application, and an MCP server that exposes tools, data resources, and prompt templates to your application. MCP originated as part of an internal Anthropic project to extend the capabilities of Claude Desktop, allowing it to interact with local file systems and other external systems. The protocol was found useful in many AI applications and was subsequently published as open source to make it available to more developers.\n\nThe MCP ecosystem is growing rapidly and includes a number of MCP services developed by the open-source community and Anthropic's MCP team . It is model agnostic and designed to be easy to plug into multiple applications. For instance, a research assistant agent could connect to GitHub, Google Drive, and File System services via MCP to access and summarize data, without you having to write custom LLM tools.\n\nThe course curriculum includes a deep dive into the MCP client-server architecture, making a chatbot application MCP compatible, building and testing an MCP server, and connecting the chatbot to it. You will also learn to connect your chatbot to other trusted third-party servers to extend its capabilities, re-use your MCP server with other MCP applications like Claude Desktop, and deploy your MCP server remotely. The instructor for this course is Elie Schoppik, Head of Technical Education at Anthropic. This technology significantly eases the process for LLM application developers to connect their systems to various tools and data resources, and for tool/data providers to make their offerings accessible to many developers.",

    "description": "This youtube video provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client and server from scratch using Python. It covers the essential setup, including initializing a Python environment, creating a virtual environment, and installing necessary libraries such as `FasMCP`, `MCP_Types`, `asyncio`, and `Pathlib`. The tutorial demonstrates how to build an MCP server, defining tools (e.g., a 'Hello World' tool) and their descriptions, which are crucial for clients and Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand when to call them. It then walks through the process of creating an MCP client that connects to the server, makes requests to its tools, and processes the text-based responses. The video also includes a section on error handling for robust application development. A key highlight is the demonstration of how to integrate the custom-built MCP server with Claude Desktop by configuring the `claude_desktop_config` file, allowing Claude AI to interact with your local MCP server and its defined tools. This practical 'Hello World' example serves as a fundamental base for developing more complex AI applications that leverage the MCP client-server architecture. The MCP itself is an open protocol that standardizes how LLM applications can access context, tools, and data resources through a client-server model.",

    "description": "A mathematically grounded text that delves into the foundations of neural networks . It explains how neural networks actually work, layer by layer, and equation by equation, without assuming hype or shortcuts . The book covers a range of topics, from biology to perceptrons, backpropagation, RBFs, SOMs, Hopfield nets, and ART, providing clear derivations and precise illustrations . It is notable for balancing rigor and clarity, making it comprehensible for both math-inclined readers who can follow the formalism directly, and non-math-inclined readers who are carried forward by its prose . This resource also includes a complete Java neural network framework (SNIPE) for practical learning through coding . It addresses classic and less common architectures carefully, including delta rules, gradient procedures, growing RBF networks, and reinforcement learning with real examples . This foundational work is highly recommended for building a serious intuition about neural networks, rather than merely tuning them, and is noted to not age despite not being a new book .",

    "description": "This GitHub repository, a fork of @Zie619's initiative, is a consolidated collection of n8n workflows ('Colección de Flujos de Trabajo de n8n'). It gathers workflows from various sources, including the official n8n.io site and its community forum, public GitHub examples, blogs, and other websites. Its primary purpose is to serve as a resource for inspiration, learning, and reuse of workflows in your own n8n projects .\n\nKey features and improvements implemented in this collection include:   Descriptions in Spanish: Each `.json` file has a clear description in Spanish, detailing the actions it performs .   Duplicate Elimination: A unique hash validation process ensures that each workflow is unique in content .   File Renaming: File names have been updated for more accurate functionality descriptions, aiding in search and selection .\n\nTo use a workflow, you typically import the desired `.json` file into your n8n instance, adjust any necessary credentials or webhook URLs, then save and execute . The repository also offers interactive support through a Custom GPT and an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server . The MCP server allows interaction with this knowledge base of documented n8n flows, with instructions for use in various AI-powered tools like Cursor, Claude Desktop, and VSCode . Contributions are welcome via pull requests .\n\nThe collection features a wide variety of workflows, including those for AI reports, marketing automation, integrations with services like Gumroad, MailerLite, LINE, ChatGPT, Google Drive, Connectwise, Microsoft Teams, Google Calendar, Outlook, Airtable, Notion, LinkedIn, Stripe, HubSpot, Slack, and many more [6-653]. It also includes complex AI-driven automations such as multi-agent AI conversations, AI-powered content creation for social media, email analysis and summarization with AI, AI agents for various tasks (e.g., calendar management, sales, HR), document processing (PDF to text/markdown), image generation and analysis, sentiment analysis, and web scraping.",
