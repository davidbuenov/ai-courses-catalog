    "description": "This course, built in partnership with Anthropic, teaches the core concepts of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and how to implement it in your AI applications. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how Large Language Model (LLM) applications can get access to context in terms of tools and data resources, based on a client-server architecture. It defines how communication takes place between an MCP client, hosted inside your own LLM application, and an MCP server that exposes tools, data resources, and prompt templates to your application. MCP originated as part of an internal Anthropic project to extend the capabilities of Claude Desktop, allowing it to interact with local file systems and other external systems. The protocol was found useful in many AI applications and was subsequently published as open source to make it available to more developers.\n\nThe MCP ecosystem is growing rapidly and includes a number of MCP services developed by the open-source community and Anthropic's MCP team . It is model agnostic and designed to be easy to plug into multiple applications. For instance, a research assistant agent could connect to GitHub, Google Drive, and File System services via MCP to access and summarize data, without you having to write custom LLM tools.\n\nThe course curriculum includes a deep dive into the MCP client-server architecture, making a chatbot application MCP compatible, building and testing an MCP server, and connecting the chatbot to it. You will also learn to connect your chatbot to other trusted third-party servers to extend its capabilities, re-use your MCP server with other MCP applications like Claude Desktop, and deploy your MCP server remotely. The instructor for this course is Elie Schoppik, Head of Technical Education at Anthropic. This technology significantly eases the process for LLM application developers to connect their systems to various tools and data resources, and for tool/data providers to make their offerings accessible to many developers.",

    "description": "This youtube video provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client and server from scratch using Python. It covers the essential setup, including initializing a Python environment, creating a virtual environment, and installing necessary libraries such as `FasMCP`, `MCP_Types`, `asyncio`, and `Pathlib`. The tutorial demonstrates how to build an MCP server, defining tools (e.g., a 'Hello World' tool) and their descriptions, which are crucial for clients and Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand when to call them. It then walks through the process of creating an MCP client that connects to the server, makes requests to its tools, and processes the text-based responses. The video also includes a section on error handling for robust application development. A key highlight is the demonstration of how to integrate the custom-built MCP server with Claude Desktop by configuring the `claude_desktop_config` file, allowing Claude AI to interact with your local MCP server and its defined tools. This practical 'Hello World' example serves as a fundamental base for developing more complex AI applications that leverage the MCP client-server architecture. The MCP itself is an open protocol that standardizes how LLM applications can access context, tools, and data resources through a client-server model.",

    "description": "A mathematically grounded text that delves into the foundations of neural networks . It explains how neural networks actually work, layer by layer, and equation by equation, without assuming hype or shortcuts . The book covers a range of topics, from biology to perceptrons, backpropagation, RBFs, SOMs, Hopfield nets, and ART, providing clear derivations and precise illustrations . It is notable for balancing rigor and clarity, making it comprehensible for both math-inclined readers who can follow the formalism directly, and non-math-inclined readers who are carried forward by its prose . This resource also includes a complete Java neural network framework (SNIPE) for practical learning through coding . It addresses classic and less common architectures carefully, including delta rules, gradient procedures, growing RBF networks, and reinforcement learning with real examples . This foundational work is highly recommended for building a serious intuition about neural networks, rather than merely tuning them, and is noted to not age despite not being a new book .",

    "description": "This overview guide from Anthropic provides comprehensive insights into prompt engineering for Claude models. It outlines fundamental assumptions before starting prompt engineering, such as having clear success criteria and empirical testing methods. The guide emphasizes that prompt engineering is significantly faster, more resource-efficient, and cost-effective than fine-tuning for controlling model behavior. Key advantages include maintaining model updates, time-saving, minimal data needs, flexibility for rapid iteration, better domain adaptation, improved comprehension of external content like retrieved documents, preservation of general knowledge, and increased transparency. The guide organizes prompt engineering techniques from most broadly effective to more specialized, suggesting a specific order for troubleshooting performance, which includes being clear and direct, using examples (multishot prompting), letting the model think (chain of thought), utilizing XML tags, assigning roles (system prompts), prefilling responses, chaining complex prompts, and tips for long contexts. It also touches upon related topics such as tools (e.g., Bash, Code execution, Web search) and their implementation, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), various use cases like customer support and legal summarization, strategies for testing and evaluation, and methods to strengthen guardrails against issues like hallucinations and prompt leaks. The guide also references interactive tutorials available on GitHub and Google Sheets for a hands-on learning experience.",

The paper explores the rapid evolution of LLMs since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, highlighting their powerful performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks .\n\nThe article delves into how LLMs acquire their general-purpose language understanding and generation capabilities by training billions of parameters on massive amounts of text data, as predicted by scaling laws . The research reviews the most prominent LLM families, including GPT, LLaMA, and PaLM, and discusses their features, contributions, and limitations . It also provides an overview of techniques developed for building and augmenting LLMs . Furthermore, the paper analyzes popular datasets used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating LLMs, and reviews widely used evaluation metrics. It includes a comparison of the performance of several popular LLMs on a set of representative benchmarks.

This tool is designed to simplify the process of connecting existing APIs to AI agents and Large Language Models (LLMs) .\n\nUpon creation, the custom MCP server generated by this builder is ready for immediate use in various AI-powered applications such as Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Docker, and more .\n\nThe process for generating and deploying an MCP server is streamlined into three easy steps :\n1.  Selection and Download: Users begin by accessing the platform via the provided link and can mix and match any desired API endpoints. The builder then generates a custom zip file for download. This comprehensive zip file includes a README with setup instructions, the selected endpoints, all necessary files to run the MCP server locally (compatible with environments like Cursor, Windsurf, and Docker), and an `.env` file with prefilled variables, requiring only the addition of API keys .\n2.  Local Setup: Once the zip file is unzipped, users open their terminal, run `npm install` in the root folder to install dependencies, and then insert their API keys into the `.env` file .\n3.  Connection: The final step involves navigating to an MCP-compatible application, such as Postman Desktop, Claude, or Cursor. Users select the MCP option, point to their `mcpServer.js` file, and click 'connect' to bring their custom MCP server live and operational .\n\nThis tool has been demonstrated to effectively crawl entire websites and map product URLs using Firecrawl’s `map_multiple_urls` endpoint via a custom MCP server . Users have also highlighted its utility, with one reporting successfully converting text into audio and saving MP3 files locally using the OpenAI API through this builder . It is recognized as a 'great addition to the ecosystem' for MCP functionality .",
